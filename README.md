# File Metadata Microservice

This is an API challenge from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/file-metadata-microservice). When the user uploads a file, they will receive a JSON response with the file size in bytes.

Built using Node.js w/ Express, EJS and Multer.

Future Ideas:
- Run my own tests using Mocha/Chai
- Refactor to pass FCC's beta tests
